      They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. And right there you got an almighty cloud. With practice comes confidence.

      You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Learn when to stop. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.

      Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.
      Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
